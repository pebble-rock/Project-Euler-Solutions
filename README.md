# Project-Euler-Solutions
This repository is a collection of solutions to problems posted on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). The questions test knowledge across: Number Theory, Algebra, Combinatorics, Algorithms and more. The purpose of writing these solutions is to practice core programming skills in languages which are of interest and to review associated mathematics. Current solutions have been written in JavaScript. I will be uploading more solutions in the near future, Python versions will also be submitted. I have tried to give justifications for reasoning, particularly where ideas used are non-trivial.
